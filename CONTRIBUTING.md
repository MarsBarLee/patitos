## Accessibility

Ducks are for everyone! Please provide relevant accessibility
support with your submission. For example, images need text
descriptions to accompany them.

If you don't know what your submission may need, please ask for help in

If you have suggestions on how to make existing ducks more
accessible, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/isabela-pf/patitos/issues)
or consider contributing.

and [GitHub](https://github.com/), but you can learn! The ducks that 
maintain this repository think these are helpful resources.
